  <h2>Spotlight</h2>
<p>This is to show an example of spotlighting. I am using the margin
  to change the width of the border.  I am using gradient to make the box
purple and yellow.  I made the imagae relative so it is relative to its 
normal position. I am spotlighting the sections that I want you to see.  I
also used transform to rotate the picture upside down.  I also used transition
to make the picture and text pop up or down when you hover on it.</p>

  <h2>Spotlight II</h2>
  <p>Spotlighting allows me to highlight the important things that I 
    want the user to see first.  I am using gradient to make the background
    fade from light blue to yellow.  I can use spotlighting to help make sections
    different from each other.

  <h2>Spotlight III</h2>
  <p>I can shange the shape the text is in, the position it is in,
    I can also change what a picture does when you hover over it.  
    I am only spotlighting certain sections because they are the 
    sections I want you to see.  I can create different sections, each
    unique from the last section.

<h2> What is VR</h2>
<img src="resources/Pictures/VR.jpg" alt="VR" width="200" height="250">
<p> VR stands for virtual reality, meaning that it can create a 
  3-D enviroment that can seem realisitic.  The headset goes on your head,
  and depending on what you want to do, you can play games or be in a virtual
  workplace.  They can also be portable, like the Oculus Quest. It can be used
  wherever you can get a light source so the light sensors can pick up your 
  surroundings.
