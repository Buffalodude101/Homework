<h1>Utah Trees</h1>
<p>
    For around the past 2 years, I spent most of my time working as an
    arborist,( someone who is considered a tree surgeon).  While 
    I was working, I noticed which trees were more common in the Salt Lake Valley as well
    as other areas of Utah.  In the Salt Lake Valley, I noticed more quaking aspens, blue spruce, 
    and Ponderosa Pines.  While in Southern Utah, while having similar trees, the most abundant
    is the cottonwood, which also has some of the biggest cottonwoods in America.

<h2>Utah Trees: Quaking Aspens</h2>

<p>
    The quaking aspen is the official state tree of Utah.  Withing the arborist
    industry, the aspen is also nicknamed the party tree because it grows very fast
    and then shortly after, it dies.  It can grow to a maximum of 70 feet, and the wood
    is not recommended for fire use.  They are hardy trees and for that, they are heavily
    sought out for landscape use.

<h2>Utah Trees: Blue Spruce</h2>

<p>
  The blue spruce is a tree that native to Utah as well as the Rocky Mountains.
  These trees can grow up to 75 feet tall and be 16 feet wide. Unlike the 
  quaking aspens, these trees grow very slowly and also live much longer.
  These trees also require good soil and good temperature for them to
  be able to grow.

<h2>Utah Trees: Ponderosa Pine</h2>

<p>
  The Ponderosa Pine is one of the biggest trees that grow naturally in Utah.
  They can reach a height of around 330 feet and be 13 feet in diameter.
  These trees are drought resistance and has very thick bark that helps
  these trees become a little more fire resistant.  These trees are the
  recommended pine to plant here in Utah.
